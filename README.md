Work Day Scheduler

Description

This project is designed to present the user with an editable schedule listed by hour. When the page loads, the current data is done, then the application cheks local staorage for any events and populates the time slots with that information.

Then if the user enters an event into a timeslot and clicks the save button, the text for that event is saved to local storage so that it can be reloaded the next time the page is loaded.
